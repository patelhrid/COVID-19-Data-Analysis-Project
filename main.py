"""The Global Threat of Food Insecurity from the Economic Fallout of COVID-19

Instructions
============

This Python module contains the main function and blocks of code required to run the entire
program. When this module is run, the food_security.json file is created from the factors.py module.
Call the show_graph function to produce interactive graphs in your browser of food insecurity,
confirmed COVID-19 cases, and the potential economic factors impacted by the pandemic that
influence food insecurity!
